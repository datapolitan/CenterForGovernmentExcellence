# Goals
--

+ Review the architecture for data ingest
--

+ Practice uploading data using the portal
--

+ Practice logging in and downloading data from the portal
--

+ Review best practices with data from the portal
--

+ Discuss future work on the data ingest portal and the data analysis stack

---

# Outcomes
--

+ You will understand the AWS architecture for data ingest
--

+ You will practice the data upload and download process using the website and AWS console
--

+ You will have provided feedback on the process and submitted any necessary [Github issues for problems](https://github.com/govex/aws/issues)
--

+ You will be familiar with the tech stack plans and provided feedback for future development

---

# Overview

---

# File upload exercise
--

+ Find a file on your desktop of any size and attempt to upload it to S3
--

+ The bigger the better (you're helping us test the limits of the application)
--

+ Give your thoughts on the process

---

# Hand off to S3
--

+ Heroku application writes the file to S3
--

+ Write-only permission
--

+ Can't see contents of bucket
--

+ If file names are the same, will overwrite file
--

+ Will appear in the S3 folder


---

# Logging into AWS
--

+ You should already have [an account](https://govex.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) (if not, we'll set that up now)
--

+ Will be setting up multi-factor authentication (MFA) soon

---

# Navigating to S3

--

+ .red[Make sure you do that]
--

+ [Download JHU Anti-virus](http://www.it.johnshopkins.edu/restricted/antivirus/index.html)
--

+ Scan the file
