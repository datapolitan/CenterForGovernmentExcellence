#Python for Accessing Census Demographic Data Online
##An introduction to the use of Python to query Census data through the API in order to faciliate easier access and use of Census data for analysis.

#Goals
+ Describe the basic syntax and usage of Python 3 for data analysis
+ Introduce key packages for Python to perform data analysis, including [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), and the [census](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/census)
+ Introduce application programming interfaces (APIs) and their use in data analysis
+ Discuss the various products released by the US Census Bureau and how to use them in analysis, with particularly focus on the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) 
+ Introduce the [Census APIs](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) and practice accessing ACS data via the API to perform simple analysis
+ Practice using the Census APIs to reproduce the affordability index methodology in Python
+ Discuss key needs for a Census API wrapper to support the work of the GovEx team
+ Provide key resources for setting up Python and learning data analysis in Python 

#Key Outcomes
+ You will be familiar with basic syntax, data structures, and commonly used packages for data analysis in Python 3
+ You will be familiar with application programming interfaces (APIs) and how to work with them using Python
+ You will be familiar with the Census API for accessing ACS data with Python
+ You will be familiar with key resources to help further your understanding of Python for data analysis
