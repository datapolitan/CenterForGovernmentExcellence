#Goals
+ Describe the basic syntax and usage of Python 3 for data analysis
+ Introduce key packages for Python to perform data analysis, including [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), and the [census](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/census)
+ Introduce application programming interfaces (APIs) and their use in data analysis
+ Discuss the various products released by the US Census Bureau and how to use them in analysis, with particularly focus on the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) 

---

#Goals
+ Introduce the [Census APIs](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) and practice accessing ACS data via the API to perform simple analysis
+ Practice using the Census APIs to reproduce the affordability index methodology in Python
+ Discuss key needs for a Census API wrapper to support the work of the GovEx team
+ Provide key resources for setting up Python and learning data analysis in Python 

---

#Key Outcomes
+ You will be familiar with basic syntax, data structures, and commonly used packages for data analysis in Python 3
+ You will be familiar with application programming interfaces (APIs) and how to work with them using Python
+ You will be familiar with the Census API for accessing ACS data with Python
+ You will be familiar with key resources to help further your understanding of Python for data analysis

#Some Important Terms
---

#Homeowner Vacancy Rate
> The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner housing inventory which is vacant for sale.  It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units for sale only by the sum of owner-occupied units and vacant units that are for sale only, and then multiplying by 100.

Source: [Census](https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=6629)

---

#Rental Vacancy Rate
> The proportion of the rental inventory which is vacant for rent.  It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units for rent by the sum of the renter‑occupied units and the number of vacant units for rent, and then multiplying by 100.

Source: [Census](https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=7019)

---

#Contract Rent
> The monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview.

Source: [Census](https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=6525)

---

#Gross Rent
> The amount of the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid for by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent is intended to eliminate differentials which result from varying practices with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental payment.

Source: [Census](https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=6613)

---

#Monthly Housing Costs as a % of Income
> The data for monthly housing costs as a percentage of household income are developed from a distribution of “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income” for owner-occupied and “Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income” for renter-occupied units.

Source: [Census](https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=6823)

---

#Aggregates
> The sum of the values for each of the elements in the universe.  For example, aggregate household income is the sum of the income of all households in a given geographic area.  Aggregates are frequently used in computing mean values (mean equals aggregate divided by universe count).
