---

#Challenge to you
--

+ There's a range of skills in this room
--

+ If you don't know the material, learn the techniques but focus on the intention
--

+ If you know the material, learn the intention but focus on how it's best communicated to others
--

+ Let's all learn from each other as we go through this material
---

#Housekeeping
--

+ I'll give you plenty of breaks 
--
*- please be back ready to work when the breaks are over*
--

+ We're using different versions of Excel and Operating Systems 
--
*- please be patient as I translate steps from one platform to another*
--

+ I'm going to be NYC-centric 
--
*- but will keep things broad enough to be applicable in other cities*

#Introduction to Visualization Design

---

# Why do we visualize data?
--

+ Explore
--

+ Explain
--

+ Persuade

---

# Encoding
--

+ Visual encoding is the process of encoding information visually
--

+ Every visualization is a mapping between data objects and features to visual objects and features

> We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.

##Rutherford D. Roger

---

#Why Statistics?
--

+ Tools for extracting meaning from data
--

+ Commonly understood ways of communicating meaning to others

---

#Histogram
--

+ Charts the frequency of instances in the data
--

+ Shows the frequency distribution
--

+ Values are grouped into class intervals
--

+ Best to have a consistent size to class intervals

#Distributions of Data

---

#Normal Distribution
![img-center-large](images/dist_normal.png)

---

#Long-tail Distribution
![img-center-large](images/dist_lt.png)

---

#Bi-Modal Distribution
![img-full](images/dist_bm.png)

---

#Mean
--

+ A representative value for the data
--

+ Usually what people mean by “average”
--

+ Calculate by adding all the values together and dividing by the number instances
--

+ Sensitive to extremes

---

#Median
--

+ The “middle” value of a data set
--

+ Center value of a data set with an odd number of values
--

+ Sum of two middle values divided by 2 if the number of items in a data set is even
--

+ Resistant to extreme values
--

![img-full](images/median_balance.png)

---

#Median vs Mean
![img-full](images/mean_vs_median.png)

---

#Mode
--

+ The most frequent value in a dataset
--

+ Often used for categorical data
--

![img-center-medium](images/mode.png)

---

#Measures of Central Tendency
--

+ Quantitative data tends to cluster around some central value
--

+ Contrasts with the spread of data around that center (i.e. the variability in the data)
--

+ Mean is a more precise measure and more often used
--

+ Median is better when there are extreme outliers
--

+ Mode is used when the data is categorical (as opposed to numeric)

---

class:center,middle
#Measuring Variability

---

#Range
--

+ The gap between the minimum value and the maximum value
--

+ Calculated by subtracting the minimum from the maximum

---

#Quantiles
--

+ Median splits the data set into two equal groups
--

+ Quartiles split the data into four equal groups
--

+ First quartile is 0-25% of the data
--

+ Second quartile is 25-50% of the data
--

+ Third quartile is 50-75% of the data
--

+ Fourth quartile is 75-100% of the data

---

#Interquartile Range
--

+ “Middle” 50% of data (between 1st Quartile and 3rd Quartile)
--

![img-center-large](images/iqr.png)

---

#Outliers
--

+ Any data points less than 1.5x the IQR or greater than 1.5x the IQR are considered outliers
--

+ Helps identify data points that may skew the analysis
--

+ Focus on the “meat” of the data

---

#Outliers
![img-center-small](images/outlier.png)
http://flowingdata.com/2008/02/15/how-to-read-and-use-a-box-and-whisker-plot/ 

---

#Standard Deviation
--

+ The average distance of each data point from the mean
--

+ Larger the standard deviation, the greater the spread
--

![img-full](images/std1.png)

---

#Measures of Variability
--

+ Describe the distribution of our data
--

+ Range (Maximum – Minimum)
--

+ Inter-quartile Range
--

+ Standard Deviation
--

+ Identification of outliers (1.5 x IQR)
