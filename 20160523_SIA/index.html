#Introductions 
+ Your name
+ What cities you work with

---

#Goals
--

+ Have a relaxed, informal discussion on what city managers face
--

+ Share my experiences teaching city managers in NYC
--

+ Learn a bit from you all about your experiences working with the partner cities

---

#Outcomes
--

+ We know more about the work of city managers
--

+ We know more about the work we all do

---

#Biases
--

+ I'm NYC centric
--

+ But I've lived a lot of places

---

#Technical: External
--

+ Don't know what they don't know
--

+ Irrational boosterism (data and technology can do everything!)
--

+ Irrational cynicism (data always lies and technology is always worthless)
--

+ Easily swayed by vendors
--

+ And it's hard to know who's being honest

---

#Technical: Internal
--

+ Hard to get resources
--

+ Hard to get data (formats, applications, data owners)
--

+ Hard to get approvals

---

#Legal
--

+ Easier/safer to say no
--

+ Sometimes cover to hide issues don't want to be aired
--

+ Unfunded mandates (FOIL)
--

+ Mistaken assumptions and bad precedents

---

#Cultural
--

+ Innate conservatism of government (can't move fast and break things)
--

+ Uncreative, unimaginative co-workers/employees

---

#Political
--

+ Personalities (inter- and intra-departmental)
--

+ Relations with public (the optics problem)

---

#Types of Analysis
--

+ Simple counting and sorting (PivotTables)
--

+ Charts and graphs
--

+ Simple maps
--

+ Statistical summaries (exploratory data analysis)

---
